## :ballot\_box: Governance Mechanisms

> Governance: [the process of applying any design feature or control mechanism that maintains and steers a system](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/9/30/ten-theses-on-decentralized-network-governance).

*   [Ranked choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting) - Voters use a ranked (or preferential) ballot to rank choices in a sequence on the ordinal scale: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.
*   [Budget box](https://blog.colony.io/introducing-budgetbox/) - Pairwise comparisons for budgeting.
*   [Conviction voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475) - Proposals are passed based on aggregated continuous preferences of community members.
*   [Delegated democracy](https://github.com/DAOresearch/awesome-daos/blob/master) - Delegate your votes to someone else.
*   [Holographic consensus](https://medium.com/daostack/holographic-consensus-part-2-4fd461e8dcde) - A governance mechanism that allows for local decisions that represent the interests of a global group.
*   [Quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) - Voting weight scales quadratically with the number of tokens one holds. Not sybil resistant, but only works if everyone has a single account in the system.
*   [Time boxed voting](https://github.com/DAOresearch/awesome-daos/blob/master) - Vote yay or nay on a thing within a window of time.
*   [Wait for quite](https://medium.com/@dominic_w/using-wait-for-quiet-voting-in-the-dao-12ecd9d9ccc3) - Wait until voting has quited down before closing a vote.
*   [MACI](https://github.com/clrfund/maci) - Minimum anti-collustion infrasctructure. Great for grants/investments DAOs.
*   [Snapshot](https://github.com/balancer-labs/snapshot) - Verify user's token balances, then let them sign messages to create off-chain signalling votes. [Create your Snapshot page here](https://docs.snapshot.page/guides/create-a-space)!
*   [Compound Autonomous Proposals](https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-autonomous-proposals-354e7a2ad6b7) - Let's anyone submit a proposal, then if/when there's enough delgation power the proposal can be put to a vote.

## Is it a DAO?

[DAOs as a field](https://medium.com/@mariolaul/resource-distribution-and-power-dynamics-in-decentralized-networks-ab0610bee6e1) - As long as we’re dealing with human beings, the age old struggle to accumulate power and other resources is likely to remain part of the picture. Time will tell whether the unique characteristics of decentralized networks, as compared to more traditional forms of organization, are sufficient to avoid a tendency towards concentration. Field theory, as a general theory of local social orders, can be applied to frame and analyze these dynamics — a precondition for addressing their more negative long-term consequences.

### Decentralization

*   [Defining decentralization](https://medium.com/@lex_node/defining-decentralization-for-law-58ca54e18b2a) - Exploring the definintion of decentralization in blockchains and token-economic systems.
*   [Banzhof power index](https://blog.coinfund.io/are-blockchain-voters-dummies-4a89a376de69) - A way to measure the voting power of a member in decentralized systems.
*   [Nakamoto coefficient](https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e) - A simple, quantitative measure of a system’s decentralization, motivated by the well-known Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve.

### Autonomy

*   [Web3 business models](https://github.com/FEMBusinessModelsRing/web3_revenue_primitives) - In a capitalist world, autonomy is often directly related to wealth. As such, most DAOs need money. This might look like a treasury, cash flows, or an inflationary rewards token. There just needs to be some sort of value flow that makes the organization sustainable.

### Organization

## :rocket: Scaling Solutions

As of the summer of 2020 summoning DAO on mainnet is often $100 USD in gas fees, up to $500. From there, simple things like adding new members and voting are $50-100 USD in gas. This prices most communities out of using mainnet for their DAOs. That being said, there are many sidechains and scaling solutions emerging to help DAOs thrive in the wild!

Will rework this to be Polygon specific and updated \<-- 

### xDAI

*   [Aragon.1Hive.org](https://aragon.1hive.org/#/) - Aragon on xDAI thanks to 1Hive.
*   [xDAI.DAOhaus.Club](https://xdai.daohaus.club/) - Easily spin up Moloch DAOs (V1 or V2) on xDAI via DAOhaus.

### IDchain

*   [Aragon?](https://medium.com/brightid/introducing-idchain-392c76c31d73) - Aragon on IDchain!
*   [IDchain.DAOhaus.Club](https://idchain.daohaus.club/) - DAOhaus on IDchain!

### Snapshot

While Snapshot isn't necessarily a scaling solution, it does allow DAO members to achieve rough consensus off-chain - potentially reducing the amount of on-chain transactions required to ratify decisions. That being said, you still have to submit transactions on-chain as Snapshot runs on a server.

*   [Snapshot](https://github.com/balancer-labs/snapshot) - Verify user's token balances, then let them sign messages to create off-chain signalling votes. [Create your Snapshot page here](https://docs.snapshot.page/guides/create-a-space)!
